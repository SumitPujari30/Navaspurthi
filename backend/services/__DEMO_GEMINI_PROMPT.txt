CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULES
ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: The base ID card template image is LOCKED AND UNTOUCHABLE. You are ONLY permitted to:

Insert the participant's photo into the designated photo area
Add text (name and event) to designated text fields

PROHIBITED ACTIONS:

❌ DO NOT modify, redesign, or regenerate the base template
❌ DO NOT change colors, gradients, or background elements
❌ DO NOT alter borders, frames, or decorative elements
❌ DO NOT add, remove, or modify logos or branding
❌ DO NOT change the layout, proportions, or dimensions

TASK DESCRIPTION
Generate a personalized Navaspurthi 2025 ID card by compositing participant information onto an existing template.
Input Materials:

Base ID card template (immutable reference image)
Participant's photograph (face/portrait)
Participant's full name (text string)
Event name (text string)


STEP 1: PHOTO INSERTION
Photo Placeholder Detection

Automatically identify the photo placeholder region in the template
Detect by visual cues: empty frame, bordered area, sample image, or distinct background
Common locations: top-center, left side, or within a circular/rectangular frame
If unclear, assume standard ID card photo position (upper-center or upper-left)

Photo Processing

Face Detection & Alignment

Detect the participant's face in the uploaded photo
Center the face within the placeholder area
Ensure eyes are positioned at approximately 60% height from bottom of frame
Maintain natural head-to-frame proportions (head should occupy 70-80% of height)


Resizing & Cropping

Scale the photo to fit the placeholder dimensions
Use aspect-fill method: cover entire area without leaving gaps
Crop intelligently to keep face centered
Preserve aspect ratio of the original photo


Edge Blending

Apply subtle feathering (1-2px) at edges if placeholder has rounded corners
Use soft alpha blending for circular frames
Match any existing shadow or border effects on the placeholder
Keep edges clean for rectangular frames


Quality Preservation

Maintain original photo resolution where possible
No artificial enhancement, filters, or beautification
Keep natural skin tones, lighting, and expression
Preserve participant's authentic appearance




STEP 2: TEXT INSERTION
Name Field
Location: Identify the designated name area on the template

Look for placeholder text like "NAME", "Participant Name", or empty text field
Typically positioned below photo or in lower third of card

Typography:

Font: Modern sans-serif (Poppins SemiBold, Inter Bold, or Orbitron Medium)
Size: Scale to fit field width (typically 18-28pt for name)
Weight: SemiBold or Bold
Color: Match template's text color scheme (white, neon accent, or high-contrast color)
Effects: Apply any existing text effects (glow, shadow, outline) visible in template

Formatting:

Center-align or left-align based on template design
All caps if template style indicates (check existing text)
Proper spacing and kerning
Single line if possible; two lines if name exceeds width

Event Name Field
Location: Identify event/designation area

Usually near bottom, below name, or in a secondary text area
May be labeled "Event", "Occasion", or similar

Typography:

Font: Same family as name field or complementary sans-serif
Size: Slightly smaller than name (typically 14-20pt)
Weight: Medium or Regular
Color: Match template's secondary text color or accent color

Formatting:

"Navaspurthi 2025" or as specified
Center-align or match template alignment
May include decorative elements if already present in template

Text Integration Rules

DO NOT add text outside designated areas
DO NOT create new text fields not present in template
DO NOT modify existing static text (logos, headers, institution name)
Ensure text is fully visible and not obscured by design elements
Maintain consistent baseline alignment with template grid


STEP 3: FINAL COMPOSITION
Layer Management

Base template layer (bottom, unchanged)
Participant photo layer (inserted into placeholder)
Text layers (name and event)
Preserve any overlay elements (shine effects, borders, logos)

Quality Checks

✅ Photo fits naturally without distortion
✅ Face is clearly visible and properly centered
✅ Text is legible with good contrast
✅ No elements overlap inappropriately
✅ Original template design is 100% intact
✅ Colors remain consistent with template
✅ Resolution matches input template

Output Specifications

Format: PNG (supports transparency) or JPG (if template is opaque)
Dimensions: Exact match to input template (typically 1024x640px or standard ID card ratio)
Resolution: 300 DPI for print quality (or match template DPI)
Color Space: RGB (or match template color space)
Background: Preserve template's background (transparent if template has transparency)


VALIDATION CHECKLIST
Before outputting, verify:

 Base template is pixel-perfect identical to input
 Only photo placeholder has been filled
 Only text fields have been populated
 No design elements have been altered
 Participant's face is recognizable and natural
 Text is readable and properly positioned
 No unwanted artifacts or editing marks
 File dimensions match exactly
 Output is print-ready quality


EXAMPLE WORKFLOW
INPUT:
- base_template.png (1024x640, Navaspurthi 2025 design)
- participant_photo.jpg (face portrait)
- name: "Rajesh Kumar"
- event: "Navaspurthi 2025"

PROCESS:
1. Load base_template.png → preserve as immutable background
2. Detect photo placeholder → circular frame, top-center, 200x200px
3. Process participant_photo.jpg → detect face, crop to square, resize to 200x200
4. Composite photo into placeholder with circular mask
5. Detect name field → below photo, 600px width
6. Render "RAJESH KUMAR" in Poppins SemiBold, 24pt, white with neon glow
7. Detect event field → bottom section, 500px width
8. Render "Navaspurthi 2025" in Inter Medium, 18pt, cyan accent
9. Merge all layers preserving template integrity
10. Export as PNG, 1024x640, 300 DPI

OUTPUT:
- navaspurthi_id_rajesh_kumar.png (complete personalized ID card)

TROUBLESHOOTING
If photo placeholder is unclear:

Default to top-center position, 25% of card width
Use standard portrait orientation
Apply subtle rounded corners (8px radius)

If text field positions are ambiguous:

Name: 60-70% down from top, horizontally centered
Event: 85-90% down from top, horizontally centered

If template has complex overlays:

Ensure photo layer sits BELOW decorative overlays
Text should be ABOVE all design elements for visibility
